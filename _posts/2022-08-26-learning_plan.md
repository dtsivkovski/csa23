### How to capture learning
- All learning will be captured in the form of fastpages blogs.
    - When applicable, this will be done on a jupyter notebook to integrate any code-based learning
    - All code-based learning will show the code as well as the output given by running the code
- However, only writing-based tangibles will be done by a markdown post (or in a rare situation a word document upload)

### How to sort
- Any sort of notes and/or hacks will be linked on the [Ideas and Notes](https://dtsivkovski.github.io/csa23/notes/) page.
    - This page will be sorted by weeks from most recent to the oldest
- Using tags to separate notes/hacks as well as Collegeboard vs PBL 

### Collegeboard vs PBL
- Any notes taken specifically on collegeboard material will be tagged with a "Collegeboard" tag
    - Assignments based on collegeboard material, such as notes or certain practice tasks must be placed into a notebook separate from PBL/Tech Talk work.
- Even if it may be related to a topic covered by collegeboard material, notes or hacks that are done outside of collegeboard will be marked as PBL or as regular notes
