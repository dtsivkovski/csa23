## Final Exam Reflection
- I got 30/40. I think I could definitely do better than that, however I think that part of it was me trying to stay on pace with the AP exam timing, and I did not want to spend too long on concepts that I was unsure about. I will plan to study these concepts further, such as arraylists and loops (as they are the most time-intensive questions), and will hopefully do better on the next one as a result.
