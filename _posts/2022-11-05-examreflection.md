## Final Exam Reflection
- I got 30/40. I think I could definitely do better than that, however I think that part of it was me trying to stay on pace with the AP exam timing, and I did not want to spend too long on concepts that I was unsure about. I will plan to study these concepts further, such as arraylists and loops (as they are the most time-intensive questions), and will hopefully do better on the next one as a result.

### Question 4

The correct answer that I should have picked was C, as the multiplication or division part is in integer type, which will round down to 2, even if it would have been 2.33333 if it had not been an integer.

### Question 14

I did not realize that when iterating through an arraylist using the enhanced for loop, that it already gets each vehicle and you do not need to use the get() function.

### Question 15

I chose I and II only, even though it was only I. It cannot be the second option because when it tries to check if data[k] > data[k + 1], it gets an out of bounds exception as data[k+1] on the last iteration is out of bounds.
