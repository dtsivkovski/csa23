## Reflection

Our presentation for night at the museum was quite well done and polished, we were able to present with all of our frontend and backend working as we intended. Some people who came up to us were very interested in the project, thought the idea was very useful and applicable, and were interested in using it in the future. We also were able to get some feedback, specifically in regards to the UI/frontend. Overall, we were very happy with how our presentation went and we were able to get a lot of positive feedback from all of the people who came up to us.
