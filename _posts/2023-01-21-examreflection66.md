## Reflection

I believe I was much stronger on conceptual questions such as those that involved more general/broader concepts or DeMorgan's law. However, I know that I definitely struggled on the ones that asked to find more specific errors within a given piece of code, as these simply took me too long and I still struggle to wrap my brain around it, especially when it involves nested loops.
