## Reflection

I believe I was much stronger on conceptual questions such as those that involved more general/broader concepts or DeMorgan's law. However, I know that I definitely struggled on the ones that asked to find more specific errors within a given piece of code, as these simply took me too long and I still struggle to wrap my brain around it, especially when it involves nested loops. However, I think the mass exposure to these questions really helped me solidify my concepts and was good practice to eventually get faster at solving them and recognizing what the question is asking.
