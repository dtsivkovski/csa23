# Reflection

I think I did much better on this AP MC exam than on the previous ones. I felt like I at least understood how to do every question, even if some may have taken me a bit longer. I did keep a good pace too, so that was good.

## Difficult Questions

I think one of the weirdest questions were regarding methods that were the mystery() ones where you just weren't even sure what they were supposed to do. It's one thing to try and understand a method that makes logical sense but another to understand a method that doesn't seem to really serve any logical purpose.
