# Introduction

This is a blog I am writing to document my achievements in my CSP and CSA career, as well as what I plan for my future. I'll discuss what I did before taking CS courses, the projects I have worked on, what I have learned, and what I still have yet to learn.

## Before CSP

Before CSP, I had very little computer science experience. I remember playing around with Scratch in elementary school and then python and a bit of java. I remember buying a small Raspberry Pi to have a separate device to program python on. However, the issue that I had with learning it this way was that it was difficult for me to learn without a goal in sight. I was being fed information by the tutorials, but I didn't actually understand it.

A bit later, I was one of the founding leadership in Sahil Samar's 3D Development Club (now called the Game Development Club). It was something I found interesting, and I decided that it would be a great way for me to learn a programming language (C#) while also being able to teach others. However, even with this, I still sometimes found it difficult for me to understand the Object Oriented Programming concept that was constantly in C#. Thus, I feel like I still wasn't truly learning a substantial amount about programming until I started CSP

## So far in CSP

In much of trimester 1, I was a bit overwhelmed with the daunting task of scrum master in a subject that I was mostly unfamiliar in. I was having to learn proper team management skills while also learning how Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS worked. Though it was somewhat stressful for me, I am quite proud of how our website turned out here, especially as our very first website. It was a nature/animal website designed to randomly generate images of animals for the user. We had different categories, and the user could select a specific category and get an image along with a description. I even learned how to make our own imageAPI that served image links to the user. Though relatively simple, I think a lot of this was more about the process of learning how python and html could interact through flask and jinja, and how to properly style a website. You can take a look at the images below to see.
