# Introduction

This is a blog I am writing to document my achievements in my CSP and CSA career, as well as what I plan for my future. I'll discuss what I did before taking CS courses, the projects I have worked on, what I have learned, and what I still have yet to learn.

## Before CSP

Before CSP, I had very little computer science experience. I remember playing around with Scratch in elementary school and then python and a bit of java. I remember buying a small Raspberry Pi to have a separate device to program python on. However, the issue that I had with learning it this way was that it was difficult for me to learn without a goal in sight.<mark> I was being fed information by the tutorials, but I didn't actually understand it.</mark>

A bit later, I was one of the founding leadership in Sahil Samar's 3D Development Club (now called the Game Development Club). It was something I found interesting, and I decided that it would be a great way for me to learn a programming language (C#) while also being able to teach others. However, even with this, I still sometimes found it difficult for me to understand the Object Oriented Programming concept that was found everywhere in C#. Thus, I feel like I wasn't truly learning a substantial amount about programming until I started CSP.

## So far in CSP

### Tri 1 - [Link to github](https://github.com/dtsivkovski/pmbytesproject#image-examples)

In much of trimester 1, I was a bit overwhelmed with the daunting task of scrum master in a subject that I was mostly unfamiliar in.<mark> I was having to learn proper team management skills while also learning how Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS worked. It also allowed me to get really familiar with the Github layout and how to organize the project on there, with which I think that organization is still one of my greatest strengths in PBL.</mark> Though it was somewhat stressful for me, I am quite proud of how our website turned out here, especially as our very first website. It was a nature/animal website designed to randomly generate images of animals for the user. We had different categories, and the user could select a specific category and get an image along with a description. I even learned how to make our own imageAPI that served image links to the user.<mark> Though relatively simple, I think a lot of this was more about the process of learning how python and html could interact through flask and jinja, and how to properly style a website.</mark> You can take a look at the images below to see.

### Tri 2 - [Link to github](https://github.com/NinjaBreadLord/super-duper-bassoons)

In trimester 2, I was much more familiar with how to design a website. <mark>The most major takeaway I had from this PBL was learning how to create and use databases and database tables, as well as properly understanding how Object-Oriented Programming works. It was really useful for storing and modifying data that the frontend javascript fetch could then call and display on our frontend. Through making the database for the tea shop part of our website, I learned what classes were, what objects were, and how exactly classes compared to the standard programming that we were doing before then.</mark> I'm not as proud of the website during this trimester, mainly as I believe we could have done more during this to execute our idea of a shop. However, I think that everything I learned as Technical Officer during this trimester was extremely useful and there are so many concepts I still use today.

### Tri 3 - [Link to github](https://github.com/LindaLiu1202/just_here_to_code)

Trimester 3 was the project that I was most proud of.<mark> Being required to get ourselves a sponsor this trimester, I decided that I could take this opportunity to choose an extracurricular that I really enjoyed being a part of and combine it with computer science. So I asked Ms. Emily Stevenson from the Poway Career Technical Education program to allow us to design a website to advertise the CTE program.</mark> We advertised the program by showing what courses were offered and at which schools, we had a gallery of CTE events (that used a database with images). We also had an events calendar that pulled information from a database we made, and we had an admin login that allowed only the admin to modify the important database data for ease of updating the website. We also had many more information pages about the program. Overall, this was the most successful website, as it combined many technicals that we learned over the past year with new technicals from the trimester, and it ended up looking good as a website overall.
