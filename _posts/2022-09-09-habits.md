# Focus and Habits Blog

## Psychology and the Good Life
- We think our life circumstances matter a lot - they do, but not as much
    - Doesn't make us as happy as we think
    - Applies to bad circumstances too
    - Your mind can lie to you
- What can you actually do
    - Make time for social connection
        - Spending time with friends and family
        - Even with strangers, still bumps up well-being
    - Exercise - good for physical and mental health - Sleep is also good
    - Notice the good experiences in life
    - Keep your mind from wandering by being in the present moment.

## Gratitude
- I am very grateful to all of my teachers for their teaching methods and how they aim to help us improve. I know that every single teacher at school is underappreciated by many of their students, and I know that most of them are trying their best to actually help their students. 
- I am very grateful to my entire family for taking care of me, helping me through hardship, and encouraging me to do better. I am inspired by their success and their hard work to also work hard on my own and be like them.
- Grateful for the family/friends/acquaintances/teachers that I have
- Grateful for everything I have - Computer, phone, education, money
