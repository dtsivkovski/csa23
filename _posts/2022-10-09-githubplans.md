# Github Policies
- The main repository for our project is the Didactic Bassoon project - [Link](https://github.com/NinjaBreadLord/didactic-bassoon)
- We already have a [gitignore](https://github.com/NinjaBreadLord/didactic-bassoon/blob/master/.gitignore) to avoid committing files that we don't want in version control.
- We already use issues as part of our development process, and during our team reviews
- Unfortunately, we have not been using pull requests as much as we should have. We will prioritize this as we continue with our project in the future
- Our branching system will consist of each person having their own branch, or different branches for different technicals until they are ready to be pushed to the main branch
- Yes, our issues are placed on our scrum board when they are created and managed from there.
