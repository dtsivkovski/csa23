I am surprised by how much worse I did on this test compared to the previous 66 question one, and I believe I definitely could have done better on it. My pacing on this test was better though, and I think most of my mistakes on this test can be attributed to small mistakes or misreading a small detail. . Questions . Q3 2D array with multi-way selection . On this one, my mistake was that I misread how the int[][] was initialized, as I read it as having 4 rows and 3 columns as opposed to the actual 3 rows and 4 columns. . Q5 array with A through L . This was also a small mistake, where I didn’t notice that both the rows and columns started at 1 instead of 0, so my answer for the output was based on the fact that they started at zero and not at 1. . Q6 calculate method with 2D int array parameter . I thought that the method would return the row index of an element with the largest value in the 2D array, but it was actually returning the column index instead. . Q9 compSci substring . The value of num is actually 7 and not 3 because printing a substring of the string does not affect the length of the string after that substring is printed. . Q10 concat 0s and 8s . I didn’t realize that there was a += in str += str + 0 + 8, so I selected 008 instead of 0008. . Q11 concat one two zee . For this one, I thought that printing integers automatically converts them to strings if there is a string present in the print statement, but it turns out that they get added together until a string is present, then they start to get converted to strings, so it would be 3Z instead of 12Z. . Q12 Consider the following code segment . I didn’t realize that the set method returns the value being replaced, so I thought that it would be Alex 3 times instead of Alex Bob Carl. . Q19 for loop substring . I thought that it would return the index of the first occurence of check inside str, but it was actually the index of the last occurence of check inside str. This is due to the fact that you have num = k in the for loop, so the last occurence of check inside str would be the one that is returned. . Q20 how many times exclamation point printed . I thought that ! would be printed only twice, but that is not the case as it would actually be printed 6 times. I thought that the operator in the statement was &lt; instead of &gt;, so I thought that it would only print the ! twice. . Q24 loop on string abcdef . I didn’t realize that substring(rep, rep+2) would cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown because the substring method would be trying to access a character that is out of bounds of the string. . Q25 manipulate method and animals List . Here, my answer would have been correct if the remove happened before size was calculated in the add statement, but it was not the case here and so it would have caused bear to be at the beginning and baboon at the end. . Q42 Remove zeros from ArrayList by index . In this case, I forgot that using the remove method would cause the index of the elements to be shifted, throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at the end. . Q45 strArrMethod - last day of the school year . I thought that the method is executed once for every loop in the nest for loops, which would be 15 times, but I forgot that the if statement would cause it to only be run the 4 times when the condition is true. .",

            "content": "Score: 59/66 . Reflection . I believe I was much stronger on conceptual questions such as those that involved more general/broader concepts or DeMorgan’s law. However, I know that I definitely struggled on the ones that asked to find more specific errors within a given piece of code, as these simply took me too long and I still struggle to wrap my brain around it, especially when it involves nested loops. However, I think the mass exposure to these questions really helped me solidify my concepts and was good practice to eventually get faster at solving them and recognizing what the question is asking. . Questions . Q1 addOneToEverything enhanced for loop . I thought that it was the first option, where it was an enhanced for loop that also worked to contain the same values for numbers. However, none of the code segments would actually work for it because in number 1, it would not actually change the value of the element in numbers, it just changes the value of the copy assigned within the loop. . Q2 animals array . I originally thought that the condition in the if statement should be changed to animals[i].equals(str), however that is not the case because the if statement is fine, it’s the error in the for loop that would make it go beyond the length of the String array and cause an error. . Q16 count 2D array columns . I thought that Line 5 should be changed to arr.length instead of arr[0].length, however that would not make a difference because the array is the same length each time. What did need to be changed was to fix it to be int[] row : array because otherwise it would iterate within the column which wouldn’t make sense. . Q18 Equivalent dog cat expressions . On this one, I almost got this one right but I accidentally made a mistake in the fact that I decided that a &gt; b was the opposite of a &lt; b instead of it being a &gt;= b as the opposite of a &lt; b. . Q43 partialSum method comparing two implementations . I thought that both implementations worked as intended with the first one being faster. However, it turns out that implementation 1 doesn’t actually work because it would cause an out of bounds exception (sum[j-1] in the first iteration would be sum[-1] which is not right) . Q54 recursive String method . I thought that the recusive method was comparing strings in alphabetical ascending order in the recursion. However, it was actually comparing them in reverse alphabetical order and therefore my answer was incorrect. . Q58 selectSort with int array parameter . I originally thought that Line 4 should be changed to if(numbers[k] &gt; numbers[pos]), however that is not the case because changing Line 2 to int post = j makes sense because you do not want the position to be reset to the 0th index every time when you are doing this sorting method. .",

Result: &quot; + x); } } public class PolymorphismExample { public void testOutput(int x) { System.out.println(&quot;Integer: &quot; + x); } public void testOutput(String x) { System.out.println(&quot;String: &quot; + x); } public void testOutput(double x) { System.out.println(&quot;Double: &quot; + x); } } StaticExample se = new StaticExample(); ExtendsExample ee = new ExtendsExample(); se.main(null); ee.main(null); PolymorphismExample pe = new PolymorphismExample(); System.out.println(&quot; nPolymorphism Example:&quot;); pe.testOutput(5); pe.testOutput(&quot;Hello&quot;); pe.testOutput(5.5); . Add 1. Result: 13 Add 5. Result: 18 Polymorphism Example: Integer: 5 String: Hello Double: 5.5 . Polymorphism - Polymorphism is the ability to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This is useful when you want to have multiple methods that do the same thing but with different parameters. This is also useful when you want to have a method that can take multiple types of parameters. Overloading is when you have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. | Overriding is when you have a method with the same name and parameters as a method in a superclass but you want to modify the method in the subclass. | Late binding is when you have allow the compiler to determine which method to use at runtime instead of compile time. Abstract Class - Objects cannot be created from an abstract class, they can only be extended. This is useful when you want to create a class that can be extended but not instantiated. | . | . abstract class Car { public void distanceDriven() { System.out.println(&quot;Car has driven 100 miles&quot;); } } class SUV extends Car { public void distanceDriven() { System.out.println(&quot;The SUV has driven 80 miles&quot;); } } class Truck extends Car { public void distanceDriven() { System.out.println(&quot;The truck has driven 50 miles&quot;); } } // Instantiating the Car class would throw an error as it is abstract SUV suv = new SUV(); Truck truck = new Truck(); suv.distanceDriven(); truck.distanceDriven(); . The SUV has driven 80 miles The truck has driven 50 miles . Subclass Constructor / Super - Extending a class and then constructing the new extends class will call the constructor of the superclass. This is useful when you want to have a constructor that will call the constructor of the superclass. | Referencing Superclass - Using the super keyword allows you to reference the superclass of the current class. This is useful when you want to reference the superclass of the current class. | . public class AClass { public void aMethod() { System.out.println(&quot;This is a method from AClass&quot;); } } public class BClass extends AClass { public void bMethod() { super.aMethod(); } } // Constructing a BClass object will call the constructor of the AClass object BClass bc = new BClass(); bc.bMethod(); // Referencing superclass method AClass ac = new BClass(); ac.aMethod(); . This is a method from AClass This is a method from AClass . Standard Methods - ToString is a standard method that is used to convert an object into a string. Equals is useful for comparing two objects to see if they are equal. HashCode is useful for getting a unique hash code for an object. | Big O Notation - Implementing Big O notation is useful for determining the efficiency of an algorithm. Making algorithms more efficient is useful for making programs compile and run faster and likely reduce the load of it, which could be especially good for websites where users may be runnning the same function through an api many times. | .",

            "title": "CS Achievements Blog",
            "content": "Introduction . This is a blog I am writing to document my achievements in my CSP and CSA career, as well as what I plan for my future. I’ll discuss what I did before taking CS courses, the projects I have worked on, what I have learned, and what I still have yet to learn. . Before CSP . Before CSP, I had very little computer science experience. I remember playing around with Scratch in elementary school and then python and a bit of java. I remember buying a small Raspberry Pi to have a separate device to program python on. However, the issue that I had with learning it this way was that it was difficult for me to learn without a goal in sight. I was being fed information by the tutorials, but I didn&#39;t actually understand it. . A bit later, I was one of the founding leadership in Sahil Samar’s 3D Development Club (now called the Game Development Club). It was something I found interesting, and I decided that it would be a great way for me to learn a programming language (C#) while also being able to teach others. However, even with this, I still sometimes found it difficult for me to understand the Object Oriented Programming concept that was found everywhere in C#. Thus, I feel like I wasn’t truly learning a substantial amount about programming until I started CSP. . So far in CSP . Tri 1 - Link to github . In much of trimester 1, I was a bit overwhelmed with the daunting task of scrum master in a subject that I was mostly unfamiliar in. I was having to learn proper team management skills while also learning how Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS worked. It also allowed me to get really familiar with the Github layout and how to organize the project on there, with which I think that organization is still one of my greatest strengths in PBL. Though it was somewhat stressful for me, I am quite proud of how our website turned out here, especially as our very first website. It was a nature/animal website designed to randomly generate images of animals for the user. We had different categories, and the user could select a specific category and get an image along with a description. I even learned how to make our own imageAPI that served image links to the user. Though relatively simple, I think a lot of this was more about the process of learning how python and html could interact through flask and jinja, and how to properly style a website. You can take a look at the images below to see. . Tri 2 - Link to github . In trimester 2, I was much more familiar with how to design a website. The most major takeaway I had from this PBL was learning how to create and use databases and database tables, as well as properly understanding how Object-Oriented Programming works. It was really useful for storing and modifying data that the frontend javascript fetch could then call and display on our frontend. Through making the database for the tea shop part of our website, I learned what classes were, what objects were, and how exactly classes compared to the standard programming that we were doing before then. I’m not as proud of the website during this trimester, mainly as I believe we could have done more during this to execute our idea of a shop. However, I think that everything I learned as Technical Officer during this trimester was extremely useful and there are so many concepts I still use today. . Tri 3 - Link to github . Trimester 3 was the project that I was most proud of. Being required to get ourselves a sponsor this trimester, I decided that I could take this opportunity to choose an extracurricular that I really enjoyed being a part of and combine it with computer science. So I asked Ms. Emily Stevenson from the Poway Career Technical Education program to allow us to design a website to advertise the CTE program. We advertised the program by showing what courses were offered and at which schools, we had a gallery of CTE events (that used a database with images). We also had an events calendar that pulled information from a database we made, and we had an admin login that allowed only the admin to modify the important database data for ease of updating the website. We also had many more information pages about the program. Overall, this was the most successful website, as it combined many technicals that we learned over the past year with new technicals from the trimester, and it ended up looking good as a website overall. . So far in CSA . Tri 1 - Link to site . This trimester was really about coming back to the PBL style in a new programming language. I started out struggling in Java, as I was struggling to wrap my head around what all this &#39;public&#39; and &#39;private&#39; and &#39;void&#39; all meant. As a result, my first month of coding featured me switching tabs between google and vscode, looking up how to write a simple class with a method in Java. However, I started to finally understand it and am now familiar enough to be able to write without needing google opened up all the time. I also saw the advantages of using Java as a language, as it being a strongly type language is something that actually becomes more convenient as you come to use it more. Our PBL was a K-Pop song website, which pulled data from our backend to display on the fastpages frontend. I liked this style more, as having our frontend be on fastpages meant less work for CSS styling (and less work to scale for mobile pages), which allowed me to focus more on the backend and setting up the API stuff there. A lot of my success in PBL this trimester was mainly due to my organization. I managed to keep my team organized and had issues for them to work on. However, I think I could have done more to learn more specifics of Java backend development as well as deployment. . My strengths / what I’ve learned . Throughout all of this, I have learned a lot and I’ve started to notice my strengths when it comes to working on Computer Science work. . Organization - This is without a doubt my strongest value, I think that a large part of it stems from me starting out CSP as a scrum master. I like to make sure that myself and my team is organized and that I can confidently start working on something after having a plan laid out. | Python backend and databases - After a whole year of working with Python, I feel very confident in my ability to use it properly and implement different programs using it. I also have become very familiar with the use of databases due to the fact that I worked on most of the database work in almost every CS group that I’ve been in. I see how useful they are for storing information as well as their potential for uses beyond that, such as for user/social interaction. | . Plans for the future . Near future . For my near future, I want to make sure to focus more on learning the concepts that I am less familiar with and be more versatile in what I can do. The main areas I would like to focus on are: . Java backend development Understanding JPA better and what I can do with it | Seeing if there are any Java packages or libraries that could be useful for my next PBL | . | Deployment I think deployment is my weakest subject. Though I have played around with it on a raspberry pi and have set up servers for certain games through Oracle, I think that it would be best for me to better understand deployment by doing it for the project this new trimester. | . | Overall understanding of Java I think that there are still a few things in Java that I could understand better, such as using Arraylists as well as still adjusting to Java syntax and formatting. | . | . Further future . For my further future, my goal is to get into a good university as a computer science major. My reach goals would be either the University of Washington CS program or the Berkeley EECS program, as both seem to be very prestigious compared to the programs at other universities. Apart from doing CS in college, I want to also get an internship in the CS field as early as possible, and I think that to best stand out in getting an internship I must first focus on the goals I have laid out for my near future. .",

Final Exam Reflection . I got 30/40. I think I could definitely do better than that, however I think that part of it was me trying to stay on pace with the AP exam timing, and I did not want to spend too long on concepts that I was unsure about. Additionally, there were a few problems that really tricked me, such as the one that returned the recursive function twice instead of just once. Overall, I think that though this is a decent score, I could definitely do more practice. I’ll pay more careful attention to certain parts of the problem that I may have usually glanced over. I will plan to study these concepts further, such as arraylists and loops (as they are the most time-intensive questions), and will hopefully do better on the next one as a result. | . Question 4 . The correct answer that I should have picked was C, as the multiplication or division part is in integer type, which will round down to 2, even if it would have been 2.33333 if it had not been an integer. . Question 14 . I did not realize that when iterating through an arraylist using the enhanced for loop, that it already gets each vehicle and you do not need to use the get() function. . Question 15 . I chose I and II only, even though it was only I. It cannot be the second option because when it tries to check if data[k] &gt; data[k + 1], it gets an out of bounds exception as data[k+1] on the last iteration is out of bounds. . Question 19 . The opposite of !(a != b) is only (a != b). Therefore, it would be applicable to use an OR operator with this opposite value here. . Question 25 . Out of these interfaces, I believed that III would also work as I thought that knowing both surface area and volume can be used in a formula to identify if the boxes could fit within each other. However, I neglected the fact that the ‘smaller’ box could just be really long and not fit in the larger box. . Question 30 . This returns only ilercom and not ilercomp, as the final index of the second part is to up to howFar, which would only be com. . Question 31 . In this case, I believed that the same array would be printed because I thought that passing it into the function does not actually change its values. However, it seems like passing it into the function still does change the values of it and thus would give the result. . Question 33 . On this one, I believed that incrementing the sum would eventually close the loop. However, because of the OR gate, it would continue on infinitely because k never increments and it would satisfy the while loop condition. . Question 34 . Only II works in this one, as in choice III, x and y are private variables and thus cannot be accessed and modified in that way by the missing code. . Question 39 . I did not notice that it was return recur(recur(n/3)); and not return recur(n/3);. As a result, it would actually go from 27 to 9 to 18 to 6 to 12 to 4 to 8 to 16. .",

Truth tables - can be used to determine the output of one or more boolean expressions. Start by writing a combination of one or two values for each condition, then writing the output that would happen when those two booleans are combined through what operator they have. | Compound boolean expressions - Involve the use of two or more booleans to satisfy a condition in code. In this case, we are using boolean expressions in the Checker class where we use (number &gt; 100 || number &lt; 1) to determine if the number is out of range, which needs one of two conditions to be met, hence the OR operator. | De Morgan&#39;s Law - States that the conditions met can be written in a different way and still give the same output. For example NOT(A or B) = NOT(A) and NOT(B). This is useful when trying to simplify boolean expressions to be more legible for yourself and for others. | .",

Vocab in this unit . Creating a class - Classes are capitalized, while methods should be camelcase (lowercase first then capitalize beginning of each word after). Should include a constructor and then any other methods that are necessary. | Mutator Methods - Seen in the Goblin class above, a mutator method is a public method that changes the attributes of the object by running the method with a parameter, this is like a setter as it is responsible for changing a variable. | Accessor Methods - Seen in the Goblin class above, an accessor method is a public method that returns the value of an attribute of the object, this is like a getter as it is responsible for returning a variable. | Static methods - Seen in the Duel class above, static methods are not in the instance of an object but rather are accessed by each object. They are used to perform a task that is not specific to an object. | Access modifiers - Private is used to hide an attribute or method to not be accessible by anything outside of the class itself. Public is used to make an attribute or method accessible by everything outside of the class. Protected is used to make an attribute or method accessible by anything outside of the class itself and any subclasses. This is seen in the various attributes of the Goblin class. | Nested loops - Seen in WordMatch.scoreGuess(), nested loops can be used to compare multiple values of two lists, or iterate through multidimensional arrays. In this case, the nested for loop is used to iterate through the secret word and the guess. | Comparing Strings - Also seen in WordMatch.scoreGuess(), the iteration compare each letter of the word and gives points for correctness. | Main/Tester Methods - The main program is intended to be run as a tester for the rest of the class. It is used to test the methods of the class and make sure they are working properly. In this case, the main method of Duel is used to test the Duel class with predefined values. | Math.random() - This allows the creation of a random float from 0 to 1, and then can be multiplied to create a certain random integer value. This is used in the Duel class to try and randomly have a critical hit while still allowing for a predefined chance of a critical hit. | .",

Though this was pretty useful to figure out how imageIO worked, I don&#39;t see a particular use for it in the website about Kpop/Korean Culture The issue I see is that this image manipulation has to be done through the backend, which would make any sort of user input feel slow as they would have to wait for the page to refresh to display a changed version. | . | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
